For the stylesheet, you will want to make a few simple changes: 
1. rename to main.css - It's just a more standard convention
2. move to a folder called "styles" and update the path to "styles/main.css"

	<!-- 
	For websites you have to use something called a relative path. 
	See: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp
	This will just update to web.htm

	I updated the spacing and format. You want to make sure that the code you write is organized, so it's easy to read.
	When you are inside an element (RE: the div here) you will want to use a tab and keep things aligned within. See below.
