<p>
	LOGOS come in many forms: Pictorial, Abstract Marks, Emblems, Mascots, & Woordmarks / Lettermarks. They are the visual core of your company.
</p>
<p>
	ICONS are the visual cues of navigating a website, understanding the order of information within a printed page, or simply the representations of each feature in an app.

	There are plenty of companies that will give you cheap logos and icons through templates. They are the "plug and play" of digital art, but the price you pay will be in having a generic, over-used brand identity that will be difficult to distinguish from everyone else.
